《Computer Scientists Establish the Best Way to Traverse a Graph》：Dijkstra算法，被证明是解决单源最短路径问题（Single-Source Shortest-paths Problem，简称SSSP）的最优算法。

算法一开始是Dijkstra陪老婆逛街购物时想出来的：
In 1956, the 26-year-old Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra wanted to write a program that would show off the capabilities of a brand-new computer called the ARMAC. While shopping with his fiancée in Amsterdam, he stopped in at a café for a break. That’s when he hit on the idea for the algorithm (opens a new tab) that now bears his name. He didn’t have writing materials on hand, so over the course of 20 minutes he worked out the details in his head.
