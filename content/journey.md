现在我在温哥华念计算机科学的研究生。

## 约饭约玩
如果你路过附近，温哥华有不少味道很好的餐馆，欢迎找我约饭。此外，温哥华周边的徒步路线非常棒，也可以拉我去活动活动。

## 雇我干活
我预计2026年春季毕业。在那之前，如你要找实习生或兼职，我在市场、运营、数据和系统方面的经验也许可以为你所用，请联系我。

### Currently
I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science in Vancouver.

### Meet Up
If you're in the area, Vancouver has many excellent restaurants - I'd be happy to join you for a meal. Additionally, the hiking trails around Vancouver are fantastic, and I'm always up for some outdoor activity.

### Work With Me
I expect to graduate in Spring 2026. Until then, if you're looking for an intern or part-time help, my experience in marketing, operations, data, and systems might be valuable to you. Please reach out.
