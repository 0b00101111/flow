# flow

This is a capture system to help me quickly jot down thoughts(As an ADHDer they can pop up all the time) without breaking my focus.

This System is implemented with Telegram Bot + Github Pages + Hugo

# key features (to be updated)

## Quick Capture + Smart Processing

**Instant Brain Dumps**: Send thoughts to Telegram whenever inspiration strikes - it takes seconds and doesn't require context switching
Tag-Based Organization: Use simple hashtags to indicate what should happen with each thought:

- #thought - For quick, fleeting ideas
- #draft - Save for later editing
- #publish - Post immediately to your blog
- #thread - Schedule for posting to Threads


## Time-Friendly Processing:

**Send and forget** - the system processes everything in the background
Schedule posts for later with simple commands like /schedule in 2 hours
Set up regular "digest" posts that collect related thoughts



## ADHD-Friendly Features
This system works especially well for ADHD because:

**Low Friction Capture**: No need to switch contexts or apps - Telegram is always readily available
**Automatic Organization**: The system handles categorizing and filing your thoughts without you having to remember
**Delayed Decision Making**: You don't have to decide immediately what to do with each thought - tag it with minimal context and decide later
**Multiple Publishing Paths**: Different types of thoughts can automatically flow to different destinations
**Nothing Gets Lost**: Even random thoughts get captured, organized, and stored in a searchable format
